Part of the issue with this project is not finding test cases and parameters before working on the hardware. Here are the test cases I drew up because I couldnâ€™t keep everything straight: 

    TP-Link IP: 192.168.0.1

    ASUS IP: 192.168.50.1

    Phone (wireless) IP: 192.168.50.83

    NSM (wired) IP: 192.168.50.100

    NSM (wireless) IP: 192.168.50.199

*Desired Outcome:*

    Access to ASUS? Yes

    Access to TP-Link? Yes

    Access to ASUS, TP-Link, and Internet? Yes

    Does Wireshark collect data from NSM and phone? Yes

    =PASS

*Case 1:*

- We could try test cases where the NSM is attached to R2, but that would be arbitrary.
