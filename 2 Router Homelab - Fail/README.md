# 2 Router Homelab:

I have two routers and I’m going to try to implement a Network Security Monitor (NSM) to monitor all traffic from all networks. Please read the entire thing first. I documented the entire process – that means the failures too. _The entire project ended being a fail, so please read the entire thing first_. I documented so much and want this published to show a growth and thought process behind decisions, and to document things I’ve done when I do future homelabs. I’ve done another homelab similar to this but I didn’t document everything, so I don’t remember the exact layout.
