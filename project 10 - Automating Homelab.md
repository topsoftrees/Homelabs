# Automating Homelab Deployment 

In going through the previous projects, installing the software required too many user prompts or wasn't fully working given the system requirements. Also, one of the goals in learning is to work smarter not harder. I don't think automating this install (given the number of user prompts) is worth automating the scripts I've included in the previous projects. Docker is much easier to implement, the monitor easily matches the system requirements to run multiple containers, and easy uninstall. 

Using Docker to automate homelab instead of the bash scripts I've used in other projects.
