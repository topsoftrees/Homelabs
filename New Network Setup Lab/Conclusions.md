Since the previous lab, 
-	I learned when to stop and know when to move on from a step. In the initial topology, I came up with the topology, the IPs I wanted, and the test cases. I didn’t try to just make something work, but I had a plan and I worked on working the plan. 
-	I was more process oriented and didn’t make as many assumptions, like assuming pfSense could be loaded onto the routers or too much over-planning. In this lab, I assumed a VLAN should’ve been created. I did better in planning the setup with the ports and the connections. 

Going forward, 
-	Don’t relay too much on YouTube. It takes away from what you learn. I only actually learned when I had to struggle to find options myself. I connected the controller and AP need to be on different IPs.
-	Step away from the project and think for yourself. I should’ve been relaxed and confident in my abilities in this lab. I would’ve connected that the controller and AP need to be on different APs.  
-	Find the official documentation. Initially, I tried to install the controller on Ubuntu using a YouTube video. The installation ended up failing. I should’ve tried harder to find the official documentation for the install. It took some digging, but I should’ve started there. 
-	Sleep is important. There were a few days in there were I worked on this project all day long, didn’t take a break, and got only a few hours of sleep. 
-	Work the problem and stay calm. Slow down. Manage the chaos yourself. If you’re scared of it, jump in because that’s the only way you’ll learn. 

Future Considerations:
-	Connect an AP-configured router to the switch and creating another network like a guest network. This will only be after getting port 8 on a different VLAN and the AP on a different network. 
-	Ping 192.168.50.1, 192.168.50.2, 192.168.50.3 and see if they can be reached from the the AP.
